- may not need to use the "Tabs" for permissions in the manifest.json
- could we just change the progress bar? container name "ytp-progress-bar-container"

Things:

1. Make sure window is fully loaded in
2. Determine if an ad is playing or requested video
3. if requested video -> do nothing
4. if ad -> change speed
5. check for 2nd ad, change speed if ad
6. look for "skip ad" button, click it.
