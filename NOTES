- may not need to use the "Tabs" for permissions in the manifest.json
- could we just change the progress bar? container name "ytp-progress-bar-container"

Things:

1. Make sure window is fully loaded in
2. Determine if an ad is playing or requested video (DONE)
3. if requested video -> do nothing (DONE)
4. if ad -> change speed (DONE)
5. check for 2nd ad, change speed if ad
6. look for "skip ad" button, click it.

TODO:

- Get rid of the timeouts
- Skip ad when possible (remove timeout)
- Need a definative way to know when the first ad is over
- middle of the video ads
