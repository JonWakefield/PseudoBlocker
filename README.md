# PseudoBlocker

# Update:

Occassionally Youtube (Google) may flag users with an "Ad blockers are not allowed" pop-up for using Pseudoblocker.
It seems Youtube sends this warning out with little or no [evidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/179t1p0/false_ad_blocker_report/), as a threat to deter ad blockers.
In the meantime, clicking "report issue and stating that you are not using an ad-blocker seems to work as a bandaid solution.
Thanks.
