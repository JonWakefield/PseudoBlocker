# PseudoBlocker

# Update:

Due to YouTube constantly flagging PseudoBlocker with the "Ad blockers violate YouTube's Terms of Service" blackout message, I have removed the extension from the chrome webstore

If you still wish to use PseudoBlocker, manually installing the extension (see [here](#cloned-from-git)) seems to still work quite well. Occassionly you may still get the same blackout message, however disabling PseudoBlocker & waiting a day, then clearing your YouTube related cookies (F12 -> Application tab -> cookies) seems to fix this problem. While it is inconvient, I still find it a significant improvement over constantly watching ads.
